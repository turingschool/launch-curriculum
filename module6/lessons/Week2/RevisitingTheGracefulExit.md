title: Revisiting the Art of the Graceful Exit
---

## Learning Goals
* Revisit strategies for a graceful exit
* Strengthen your ability to respond to questions you don't know the answer to

## Warm Up
Think back to a time in an interview setting when were asked a question you didn't know the answer to.

* How do you feel? 
* Regardless of how you answered in that moment, how do you wish you'd responded to the question?

## Purpose of an Interview
We've talked about the purpose of an interview quite a few times at this point, but it's important to keep revisiting this topic because it's easy to get sucked into the idea that an interviewer is only interviewing for technical competency.

<section class="call-to-action" markdown="1">

Take a few minutes to think on these two questions, then you will discuss your thoughts with a partner and finally your instructor will call on folks to share their thoughts with the class. 

What is the job of an interviewer?

What personal qualities would you like the interviewer to walk away knowing about you?

<p><strong>Instructor Note</strong><br>
We are hoping students leave the conversation thinking something like this:

Of course they are asking you some knowledge-based questions to see what you know and what you don’t know, but more importantly, they are trying to figure out what it would be like working with you.

What type of person are you? What are you like working with teams? How much direction, supervision, and assistance will you need?

When answering interview questions, you are providing the interviewer with lots of insight and information about the personal qualities you will bring to their team. </p>

## Graceful Exit Strategies 

#### Clarifying Questions
Interview question: “Can you give me some examples of how you might optimize an application?” Response: “By optimizing an application, do you mean making it faster?”

What qualities is the interviewee displaying when they ask questions like this?

#### Pivot
Response: “I’m not familiar with that concept, but it reminds me of ____ . Could I talk a bit about that instead?”

What qualities is this interviewee displaying?

## Students Demonstrate Graceless Interview Answers

You're going to practice graceful exits in a few minutes, but first, let's practice graceless exits! This way you will have a chance to see what it feels like as an interviewer to receive a graceless answer.

Here's how this works, your instructor will start by drawing a random student for the first interviewee. Then they will ask a technical interview question and the first student will give a graceless response. Then that first student becomes the interviewer. The instructor will draw a second random student. The first student will ask a technical interview question and the second student will give a graceless response.

This will continue until everyone has a chance to ask and answer ending with the last student drawn asking a question of their instructor.

When gracelessly answering, your answers might be a short response like "I don't know", pivoting without permission, making something up, or something else! Feel free to be creative!

Feel free to use any short technical question or select from the following:

* What is the difference between an Array and a List?
* In as much detail as possible, describe the Request/Response Cycle.
* What does MVC stand for?
* What are a few benefits of automated testing?

As you are listening to graceless responses, reflect on these questions:
1. How does is feel from the interviewer's perspective to receive a graceless response?
2. What does this answer tell you about the interviewee? What qualities does it convey?

## Breakout Room Practice

Today we're going to do our breakout room practice in groups of 3 or 4.

Each person will rotate between being the interviewer, the interviewee, and the observer (for groups of 4 there will be 2 observers).

As the interviewee, answer to the best of your abilities - these questions are especially hard so you will have the opportunity to practice a graceful exit!

After the interviewee answers, the interviewer can give kind and actionable feedback, again referring to the questions above about what additional information the answer tells you about the candidate. The observer is not responsible for asking questions, answering questions, or giving feedback. They can focus on learning from observing how someone else tackles hard questions.
