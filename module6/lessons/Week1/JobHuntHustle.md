title: Job Hunt Hustle Intro
---

## Introduction

Find job you're interested in, apply to job, interview for job, receive offer: that's the process right? Sometimes that works, but more often than not the path towards a job offer is more winding and involves more "hustle" on your end.

What do I mean by "hustle"? I think of the hustle as putting in extra time and effort to help you stand out in comparison to the other candidates.

There are so many different activities this can include, and by the end of today we will have a list of "Job Hunt Hustle" activities to choose from. 

For "Job Hunt Hustle" we are not going to focus on things that help you ace the interview or grow your qualifications. We instead want to focus on things that help you move closer on the path towards jobs you want. Things that that help get your foot in the door and help you stay top of mind to potential employers.

#### Example 4
A snippet of the path towards Zoe volunteering with Code.org for a week while in college (definitely a bit cringy to look back on my old messages, but I think it's a solid example of thoughtful and genuine persistance paying off):

### Conclusion

When talking about hustle, I think it's also important to talk about rest and self care. The job search can be draining and hustling can be exhausting. We need to keep an eye on our wellbeing and ways we can personally rest and refuel.
