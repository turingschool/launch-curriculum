title: Asking Questions In An Interview
---

## Introduction

Today we're going to dive into an often overlooked part of the job interview. In addition to the interviewer asking you questions, they will also often leave 5 or 10 minutes at the end for you to ask them questions! 

The ability to ask insightful questions not only shows your genuine interest in the position but also demonstrates your preparation, critical thinking, and understanding of the company culture. It's also your final opportunity to leave a lasting impression, distinguish yourself from other candidates, and gain valuable insights into the role and the organization.

## Activity

For today's PD, we're going to do some brainstorming on potential questions to ask so that you can start compiling your list of questions! You will also want to adjust your questions as much as possible to the particular position and company, but this will hopefully give you a good starting point.
