title: Intro to Computer Science
---

Throughout our time your time at Turing, we have been putting most of our focus on teaching you the skills you will need to **do the job**.  In Mod 6, we are now focusing more on how to **get the job**.  

In addition to quetions about your experience in programming, you may come across some companies that ask questions related to **Computer Science**.  Computer Science is a _large_ topic that includes programming (which is what we have been focusing on), and some additional areas like: algorithms, data structures, and theory.

Having an introduction to some additional computer science topics can help you navigate these questions if they come up in an interview.

## What is Computer Science

## Next Steps

Now that we have an understanding of what Computer Science refers to, we can start diving in to some specific topics.  Over the next few weeks are going to cover some of the data structures that Vaidehi introduced in the video above:
- Linked Lists
- Binary Trees
- Arrays, Stacks, and Queues
