During Intermission, you worked on earning a certification in fundamental C#.  This is one way to keep up with your technical skills during a job hunt.  Another way to stay current with your skills is by practicing 'Free Throws' - activities that will help you cement core programming concepts into muscle memory.

During Mod6 we will have some dedicated Free Throw time that will focus on one of three areas: programming fundamentals, OOP Practice, and SQL Practice.
