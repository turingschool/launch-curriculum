title: Mock Interviews
---

During Mod 6, your weekly assessments will be in the form of Mock Interviews.

Each interview will be 30 minutes long and consist of both technical and non-technical questions.  Instead of receiving a score, you will be "offered a job" or "invited to re-apply" .  Regardless of outcome, you will be provided with feedback for improving your interviewing skills!

Each week, we will be focusing on a particular PD theme, and we want to see you demonstrate that theme in your interview:
* Week 1: Asking Questions
* Week 2: Graceful Exit
* Week 3: STAR and Concrete Examples
* Week 4: Talking While Coding
* Week 5: Planning

In order to be "offered a job" you must demostrate the following:
* Strong technical knowledge - answer most of the technical questions correctly.
* Ability to exit tough questions - you must demostrate graceful exiting of any question that you don't know the answer to.
* Ability to use examples to illustrate your answers - examples should be relevent and **specific**.
