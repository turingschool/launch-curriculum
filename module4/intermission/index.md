Before starting Module 4, spend a minimum of 2 hours working through the following activities.

We're going to start Module 4 by taking couple of days to adventure in Javascript world. The main focus of this course is backend development using C#, .NET, and SQL, but Javascript is such a key part of web development that's important for you to be familiar with the topic.

### Part 1 (Required): Modifying Webpages with Javascript

Start by reading the section [A High Level Definition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript#a_high-level_definition) in these MDN docs to get a sense of how Javascript fits in with HTML and CSS when building websites.

Then move on to reading [What is the DOM](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/introduction-to-the-dom#what-is-the-dom).

Your goal is to learn how to change the background color of a favorite webpage to a new color using only Javascript written in the developer console.

✅**Deliverable**✅ Take a screenshot of your result and send it to your instructors, it should look something like this:

### Part 2 (Required): Translating Javascript to C#

Your goal is to take [this program](https://replit.com/@launch-team/JavascriptToC) written in Javascript and translate it into C#. The goal is not to fully understand all of the Javascript written here but to understand at a high level what's happening enough so that you can write a program that does the same thing in C#.

The output from this Javascript code will show up in the developer's console. In Replit you can click the wrench at the top right to show the developer tools.

✅**Deliverable**✅ 
1. A new C# Repl that contains a C# version of the above Javascript code to calculate the total price of some items in a shopping cart using the discounts in the original Repl. Once you have the code working, I encourage you to try an refactor to make your code even better!
2. A message to your instructional team with the answers to the following questions:
    * How was this activity for you? Harder than expected? Easier than expected?
    * What's one part of the Javascript program you found especially easy to understand?
    * What's one part of the Javascript program you found especially confusing to understand?

### Optional
If you want to get a headstart on the Javascript content we will be learning in Mod 4 Week 1: [Unit 6 HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css-js)
