We will be using an Agile process during the development of this project. This will include:

* Working in short 1 - 3 day "Sprints"
* Using GitHub
* Using a project management tool such as Github Projects
* Conducting Story Grooming meetings
* Doing daily Stand Ups
* Demoing your project to your Project Manager
* Holding Team Retros

### git/GitHub

* Commit Frequently
* Decide on a [git workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
* Make branches and submit Pull Requests for each new feature.
    * DO NOT commit directly to main
    * Keep your PRs as small as possible (one feature / user story per PR)
    * Use screenshots and screencasts to demonstrate functionality.
    * Your PR should be reviewed by at least one team member before it is merged.
    * Tag your Project Manager if you have questions. DM your Project Manager letting them know you have tagged them.


### Story Grooming

* You should be using a project management tool to keep track of your stories.
* When doing a "Story Grooming" you should:
    * Make sure that the project board is up to date
    * Look over the current backlog of stories and decide if you want to make any changes
        * Are there any stories that need to be updated?
        * Are there any stories that need to be added?
    * Assign stories to individual team members or pairs
        * Be clear on what it is that everyone should be doing
* You should be Story Grooming every 1-2 days.

### Daily Stand Ups

* A Stand Up is a very brief (hence, physically standing up) meeting for the development team to keep in touch about what everyone is doing.
* During the stand up, each member of the team will take 1 - 2 minutes to answer these questions:
    * What have you been working on?
    * What are you going to be working on?
    * Is anything blocking you?
* Every weekday you should send your PM a summary of the day's stand up.


### Sprints

In Agile processes, a sprint is a single cycle of development. The most common length of a sprint is two weeks. During this cycle, teams will assign features, develop those features, demo their work, get feedback, and retro.


#### Sprint 1: Initial Project Setup and Database Migrations

We are going to include the Inception phase as part of this sprint.  In addition to the Brainstorming, Deciding, and Solving; during this sprint you will:

* Create your initial project in Visual Studio
* Create a github repo and add all group members as collaborators
    * ✅ Add your project manager as a collaborator
* Create the initial database migrations based on your inception discussions
* Individually pull down your project, and debug any setup issues.

✅Send a status update to your project manager when you are ready to move on to Sprint 2

#### Sprint 2: Primary Development

During this sprint, you will implement the user stories you identified in the Inception phase. Each feature should be tested!

✅Send a status update to your project manager when you are ready to move on to Sprint 3

#### Sprint 3: Final Product

The last sprint is dedicated to polishing your finished project; this should be the shortest sprint!  During Sprint 3, you will:
* Review your application from a users perspective
    * For this, it can be _very_ helpful to recruit a 'new' user from another group!
* Identify minor changes that need to be made for a better user experience
* Implment fixes

✅Send a status update to your project manager when you are finished with Sprint 3!
