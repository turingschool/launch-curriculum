During projects, it is important that you meet with your partner or your team to discuss the progress of your project, as well as, at the end of the project reflecting on its completion. These retros provide an opportunity to acknowledge what is working well so you can consciously continue doing what works. It is also important to recognize what is not working or needs improvement, so those issues can be addressed and the whole team can collaborate on a solution.

Below are questions that everyone should address together as a team. Keep an DM with your group-members and instructor going to keep track of all retro notes, and other discussions.
