    * You must have one many-to-many relationship
    * Your application must allow for each of the CRUD actions for at least one database table
* A user-friendly interface
    * users should not need to type any addresses into the address bar (except to get to your site initially)
    * Links and buttons should be clearly labeled
    * If a user tries to go to a page that does not exist, they should be redirected to a 404 page
