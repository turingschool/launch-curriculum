Prep: Review path parameter, query string parameter, GET/PUT/POST, that lesson
Listen to video about what is an API!

Intro to APIs

### Introduction

This module's focus is all about building high-quality APIs. Tomorrow you are going to learn how to build your own API using .NET! But before building our own, we need to understand how APIs work and see examples of APIs build by others.

## Learning Goals

Understand how an API works at a conceptual level
Expand our understanding of what a 'client' could be
Practice requests to an existing API - using Postman
Practice reading API documentation
Practice with path parameters, query string parameters, GET and POST, 

### API scavenger hunt
Scavenger hunt for cool APIs

❓In mod 3, what type of data did we return in our HTTP Responses?
❓What type of data does it look like these APIs are returning?


### How can we call APIs?
❓What clients have we used so far?


We're going to expand our horizons and learn Postman
Maybe also show an example of a client in Javascript? Talk about how you could also have another application calling your API, build with something like React or angular.

- Install Postman, try things with github API.

### Sending more advanced requests to APIs
-Auth token, post, query string parameters, path parameters

Maybe we use the github API for the example, mid level difficulty and has auth stuff?

Digging into what the response looks like, where in the response is...


Would like to have an example of auth token... Maybe github good example here?

### Checks for Understanding
Check for understanding with the Creative API? https://docs.xandr.com/bundle/xandr-api/page/creative-service.html

Lab:
* NYC open data
* Pokemon API

Some challenges of data to get from the API for each.

Stretch:
* Pagination
* Request size limit


Today we have looked at multiple different API docs, what do you like, what do you not like? What lessons will you take with you about what makes good documentation?


Could twilio be a good practice api where you can also put and post? https://backend.turing.edu/module2/misc/exploring_apis_workshop
