### **"HTTP is a Stateless Protocol"**

The statement above is true.  So, what does it mean?

Spend 10 minutes doing some research to determine what makes HTTP stateless.  You can use the following questions to help guide your research:
* What is 'state' in relation to web applications?
* How does a server keep track of requests that have been made to it?
* How do we 'log in' to applications?

In small groups, discuss what you have learned, and be ready to share out!

<section class='instructor-notes' markdown='1'>

Make sure you have enough time to bring students back together to do a whole group share out.  Students need to understand that each http request is a separate activity - the server does not 'remember' prior requests.
