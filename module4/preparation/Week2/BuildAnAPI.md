## Pre-work for [Build an API](/module4/lessons/Week2/BuildAnAPI)

In our MVC applications, we used controller actions to help build the **body** of our responses.  The body in MVC reponses include HTML documents - this is what the user sees!

As we saw in our [Intro to API lesson]() we saw that some web application responses include non-html data.  

Most APIs return JSON response content.  Review the W3 school's [post on JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) and answer the following questions in your notebook.  We will revisit these questions in our upcoming lesson!

* What are the 4 JSON syntax rules?
* In what languages can JSON data be written?
* What do square brackets `[]` indicate?
* What do curly braces `{}` indicate?
