Start by reviewing [Query String Parameters](/module3/lessons/Week4/QueryStringParameters). Focus on reviewing *query string parameters* and *path parameters*. 

Then watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY) video to get a better understanding of APIs.


✅**Deliverable**✅ Prepare at least one question you currently have about APIs to share during the lesson.
