title: Productive Struggle

### Warm Up
Reflect in your notebook on the following:
* During your time at Turing so far, when have you felt like you were struggling the most?
* What signs/behaviors/feelings indicate when you are struggling?
* What have you done in the past to move forward through struggle?

## Productive Struggle and the Learning Zones

**With a Partner** Review the image above.  Identify where you think 'struggle' happens.

<aside class="instructor-notes">
    <p><strong>Instructor Note</strong><br>we want students to identify that struggle can (and will) happen in the green and red zones. When you are more in the red, you are in _unproductive_ struggle.  More in the green - _productive_ struggle.</p>
</aside>


## Two Types of Struggle

When working through a challenge - in programming or otherwise.  We often find ourselves struggling to understand the problem, or developing a solution.  This struggle isn't bad, its just part of the process!  But, there are different ways of struggling through a problem - some more productive than others.  We can generally group these behaviors under either **Productive Struggle** or **Unproductive Struggle**.  Productive struggle moves you closer to your goal, while unproductive struggle is stagnant, or can even move you further from your goal. These definitions might feel familiar - we covered them in Mod0 as well!

### Identifying Productive Struggle

With your breakout group, the tallest person will share their screen and take notes as you brainstorm. Create a chart listing out behaviors that indicate when you are in productive struggle, and when you are in unproductive struggle. Take 8 minutes to just list the behaviors for each form of struggle - weâ€™ll work on strategies for avoiding unproductive struggle next.

Once you have your list, take another 8 minutes to brainstorm ways to avoid unproductive struggle, and ways to move from unproductive to productive struggle. Create a separate chart listing out these strategies.

## Strategies for Breaking out of Unproductive Struggle

<aside class="instructor-notes">
    <p><strong>Instructor Note</strong><br>This would be a good opporunity for some individual reading, and then sharing out of one strategy that resonates with them, or even a 'gallery walk' where students present on one of these to the rest of the cohort.</p>

**Clarify the Problem**  
Revisit the project spec, interaction pattern, or any supporting documents to clarify the problem you are working on.  Ask questions if necessary, and restate the problem to yourself and others to make sure you are working on the correct task.

**Think Out Loud**  
Sometimes referred to as *Rubber Ducking*. It can often help to talk through what you are trying to do out loud - either to yourself or to another person.  Just saying something out loud can help you identify where you have made a wrong move.

**Take Notes**  
Write done what you know and what you have tried.  Writing down what you know (what variables you have access to, what datatypes you are working with, what the return value of a method should be) helps focus you on the problem at hand, without getting caught up in other things.  Keeping track of what you have tried and the result of those attempts can help you keep moving forward without re-trying things that you have already seen didn't work.  It will also help others follow your logic if you need to ask for help!

**Try a Different Method**  
This might seem like common sense, but it is also a common trap that we can get into - we want so much to use a specific method, that we can tie ourselves to something that isn't going to work.  For example - if you are using `.map` and it isn't working, try `.each`.  Focus on getting it working, rather than on using the *right* method.

**Nuke It**  
CODE IS CHEAP. It's a tough lesson to learn, but a good one-- it costs nothing to delete and start over. All developers sometimes get stuck trying to force our code into a strategy, tool, or path that we're mentally stuck on and determined to make work. And sometimes, that just isn't the right direction.  It's okay (and sometimes, the best course of action) to delete what you've written, take a 5 minute pom, and start fresh when you get back as though it's the first time you've seen the problem. (Disclaimer: we're not talking about a whole project here-- don't delete your whole project the night before it's due).

**Ask for Help**  
Early! Don't spend too much time struggling before asking for help-- if you've spent more than 20 minutes on unproductive struggle, ask a fellow student, mentors, upper mod students and/or your instructors.


### Remember
Unproductive struggle is independent of how long it takes you to find a working solution.  It _is_, however, recognizing when you've stopped learning.

## Plan for the Future
In your notebook, write down two or three of the strategies above that you are going to try this week.  As you encounter unproductive struggle and use these strategies, let you instructors know so that we can celebrate with you!
