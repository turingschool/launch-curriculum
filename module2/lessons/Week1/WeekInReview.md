## Small Group 1
In small groups (3/4 students), work through these [Checks For Understanding](/module2/lessons/Week1/CFUReview) questions that cover each of this week's lessons.  Make a note of any questions or topics that are unclear - instructors will be moving around break-out rooms helping to clarify tricky topics.  If you need an instructor, use the raise-hand âœ‹ feature.

In your group, nominate 1 'spokesperson' to take the lead on sharing your group's responses in the next section.

    <p><strong>Instructor Note</strong><br>As you move through different groups, keep a list of topics that need to be addressed for the larger group.</p>

### Small Group 1.5
You will pair up with another group to compare your Checks for Understanding responses. Before starting your comparisons, name one person in this large group to be a 'time keeper' to keep an eye on the time, and keep the conversation moving.


## Small Group 2
As a group, review the weekly assessment - try to identify a few differences between your implementations.  You can use the following prompts as a starting point:

* How did you determine which songs were in the top 10?
* When updating records, was there a possibility of updating the wrong record?
* What was difficult about describing commits and branches?


As you review your assessment, come up with at least 2 questions you still have.  Choose one person in your group to send these questions to your instructors via slack DM.
