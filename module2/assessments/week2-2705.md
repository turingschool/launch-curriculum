# Week 2 Assessment

## Questions (10 Points Possible)
1. What does TDD stand for?

1. What are three benefits of using TDD?

1. Imagine you are in an interview.  The interviewer asks: How do you use TDD? How would you answer?

1. For the class below, outline the tests you would need.  Try to use as much C# syntax as possible. The first test has been provided for you. (this question is worth 4 points)
```c#
public class Dog
    {
        public string Name { get; }
        public string Breed { get; }
        public bool IsHungry { get; private set; }

        public Dog(string name, string breed)
        {
            Name = name;
            Breed = breed;
            IsHungry = true;
        }

        public void Eat()
        {
            IsHungry = false;
        }

        public void Sleep()
        {
            IsHungry = true;
        }

        public string Speak()
        {
            return "Bark Bark!";
        }
    }
```
```c#
// Add your tests here

[Fact]
public void DogHasNameAttribute()
{
    Dog dog = new Dog("Nile", "Golden Retriever");

    Assert.Equal("Nile", dog.Name);
}
```

1. What is a merge conflict, and when might you encounter one?

1. You and a partner are working on a project together.  Your partner is working on aa-branch; you are working on bb-branch.  In as much detail as possible, describe how you both would get your work combined onto the main branch.

1. Why is it good practice to have someone else approve and/or merge your PR?
