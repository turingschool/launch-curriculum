## Prework for [SQL Aggregates](/module2/lessons/Week3/SQLAggregates)

In your notebook, define the following terms:
1. Minimum
2. Maximum
3. Sum
4. Average

If you are unsure of what these terms refer to, check out the guide below, then redefine them in your own words.

### Some Math Terms
* Min: The first item in an ordered list. EX: the smallest of a set of numbers.
* Max: The last item in an ordered list.  EX: the largest of a set of numbers.
* Sum: The total of a collection of numbers. EX: the sum of {1, 3, 5, 4, 2} is 15. `1 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 1`
* Average: A single number that represents the commonality of a set of numbers. Add up a series of numbers and divide the sum by the total number of values to find the average. EX: the average of {1, 3, 5, 4, 2} is 3. `(1 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 2) / 5 = 3`

Watch [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JrQ4HApwLY) That introduces Aggregate Functions.  After watching the video, reflect on the questions below in your notebook:

1. Create a definition for the word 'aggregate'.
2. Do you think we could find the 'MIN' value of a text field?  Why, or why not?
3. What do you think 'NULL' represents in SQL?

Watch [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guJAF0NMHII) which introduces GROUP BY.  After watching the video, reflect on the questions below in your notebook:

1. In your own words, how does 'GROUP BY' change the behavior of aggregate functions?
2. Copy the text that is shown in the video at [3:53](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxeqiaHjRKAIYr9qJ--wF5sccJT-V1HmaC).  Do your best to unpack the statement - what does it mean?
