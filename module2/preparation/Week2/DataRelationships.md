## Pre-Work for [Data Relationships](/module2/lessons/Week2/DataRelationships)

Tomorrow we are going to learn how to represent more complicated data relationships in our SQL databases. It's been a while since we've talked about databases! 

To prepare, review the [Intro to Databases](/module2/lessons/Week1/IntroToDatabases) lesson. Write down questions that come up as you're reviewing the intro lesson so that you can ask them tomorrow.
