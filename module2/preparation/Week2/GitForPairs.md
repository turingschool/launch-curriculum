## Pre-Work for [Git for Pairs](/module2/lessons/Week2/GitForPairs)

Tomorrow we are going to learn how to use git to collaborate with other developers. 

To prepare, first re-watch the following video lessons:
  >1. [Create A Project and Initialize a Git Repository](https://www.loom.com/share/d3af392e059147a699ce6ac1af65d251)
  >1. [Add Commits to the Git Repository](https://www.loom.com/share/b7373e5aaad646c790965422719bb993)  
  >1. [Creating and Pushing to a Github Repository](https://www.loom.com/share/dba188a5f13e43059d9a84b630280c53)

Then review the rest of the content in the [version control and solo git lesson](/module2/lessons/Week1/VersionControlAndSoloGit).

Specifically, remind yourself what the following terms mean with regard to git. I will call on folks to share their definitions of these terms at the start of class:
* Git
* Github
* Local Repository
* Remote Repository
* Commit
* Push
* Branch
