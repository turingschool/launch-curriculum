## Pre-Work for [Database Migrations](/module2/lessons/Week5/DatabaseMigrations)

Read through the Microsoft documentation on Migrations. Stop when you get to the `Excluding parts of your model` section: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli. 

It's your choice if you want to follow along or just read.

While you read the documentation, write your answers to the following questions. Be prepared to share your answers during the Database Migrations lesson:

1. How would you describe the process of evolving your model to add a new column?
1. What's one thing you learned about migrations from reading this documentation?
1. What's one question you currently have about migrations?
