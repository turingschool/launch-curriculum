## Preparation

The next lesson will combine two concepts you've learned recently: CRUD and ORM. Remind yourself:

1.  What does the acronym CRUD stand for?
2.  What SQL keywords are used for each CRUD operation?
3.  What tools have we used to create and manipulate our database?
4.  What does the acronym ORM stand for?
5.  Describe the purpose of using an ORM.
6.  What is the name of the specific ORM we have used in this module?
