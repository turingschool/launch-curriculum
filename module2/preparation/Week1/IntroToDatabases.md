## Pre-Work for [Intro To Databases](/module2/lessons/Week1/IntroToDatabases)

Spend about 20 minutes reviewing your final Mod1 Project.  Brainstorm some additional features that would make it more useful for users.  To help get you started, you could think about the following questions:
* Does this program allow a user to ever quit and restart the program?  What is that experience like?
* What happens if a user gets a new computer?
* Can users make changes to messages that they have created?

Describe the additional features you have brainstormed in as much detail as possible.  When finished, share those features with a partner - ask each other questions about why those features would be useful, and what would be necessary to implement those features.  Feel free to imagine things that don't yet exist, and/or things that you don't know how to do yet!
