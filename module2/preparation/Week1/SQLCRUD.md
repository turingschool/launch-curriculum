## Pre-Work for [SQL CRUD](/module2/lessons/Week1/SQLCRUD)
* Explore inserting data into the database tables

So far, we have created the structures of a database, but we have not created any data.  Work through [this W3Schools' Insert Documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_insert.asp).  Complete as much of the [exercise](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_insert1) at the bottom as you can.

When you have completed (or spent 30 minutes working on) the exercise reflect on the following questions:
* What information do you need to know about a table to insert rows into it?
* How do you insert partial data?
* How can you confirm that you successfully created new rows?
