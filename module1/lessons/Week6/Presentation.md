# Presentation Guidelines

This guide serves as a general outline for how you can present your code during a project demonstration.

<hr>

## Prior to the presentation:

- Clear your screen of all windows or tabs except the ones relevant to your presentation. 
- Have all relevant software (e.g. Visual Studio, Google Chrome) launched and ready to go.
- Run through your project to make sure any issues have been resolved.
- Practice your presentation a few times before your live demo.

<!-- **Suggested steps for presenting your project:** -->
## Presenting your project:

### 1. Overview
  - Start with an overview of the app that you built, summarizing the tasks of the challenge. This can be as simple as verbally stating the main functions of the app.

<br/>

### 2. Functionality

  - Run through your program from start to finish. Be sure to highlight relevant user interactions, such as the prompts for user input and what happens immediately afterwards.
  - If you have written tests, this is a great time to run them and show how well your tests validate the functionality of your methods. This is often referred to as "test coverage".

<br/>

### 3. Code

  - Highlight 2-3 pieces of code that you are particularly proud of, either because it was a challenge and you figured it out, it’s something new you implemented, or because that piece of code makes you feel like a wizard! 
  - There's usually no need to walk through the fine details of how the code is working, you can safely assume your reviewer is familiar with the C# language, the Visual Studio, and any other developer tools you may have used.
  - If your reviewer asks specific questions, feel free to get into the nitty-gritty. 

<br/>

### 4. Questions

  - Ask if the reviewer has any questions or would like to see anything else. 
  - Optionally, you can invite feedback from your reviewer. The more specific the feedback you ask for, the better. (ex. "I would love to hear your thoughts on how I structured my database" or "I would love feedback on how I constructed my components.")

## Some General Do’s & Maybe Not’s

### Do:

- Show off code that you are proud of.
- Admit when there is a known bug. It’s better if you tell them about it than if they find it and wonder if you missed it. When you share a known bug, you can talk about why you think it might be happening, what you tried, and what you might try next if you had more time (including reaching out to mentorship for help). This will show you’re thoughtful and familiar with your code.
- Be familiar with the tasks that were given to you and make sure to show each feature and any testing that went along with it. Be proactive and show this instead of waiting for the interviewer to ask you for each item.

### Maybe Not:

- Walk through your code, line by line, explaining what each line does. This takes up a lot of time and often the interviewer understands how it is working. If they need clarification, they will ask.
- Start your presentation with "What would you like to see?" It's better to be proactive and take them through your code.

## Final Notes

- Keep in mind that some companies will have their own guidelines on presenting which takes precedence over this guideline.
- The above steps are not written in stone and if you prefer to switch up the order, that is fine. The more important idea is that you have a process for showing your code in a succinct, effective way. Using this guideline can help to ensure you hit all the relevant points about your app and your process.
