# Week 3 Review Guide

** Instructor Note **  For this review, we want to go over the three spicier iteration problems from earlier in the week's labs.  Plan to spend some extra time between groups1 and 2 to highlight students progress toward implementation of these problems.  If necessary, you may demonstrate an implementation of the problems so that students have at a minimum seen the patterns of transforming, finding, and building in iteration.

## Small Group 1
In small groups (3/4 students), work through these [Checks For Understanding](/Mod1/Lessons/Week3/CFUReview.md) questions that cover each of this week's lessons.  Make a note of any questions or topics that are unclear - instructors will be moving around break-out rooms helping to clarify tricky topics.  If you need an instructor, use the raise hand ✋ feature.

** Instructor Note **
As you move through different groups, keep a list of topics that need to be addressed for the larger group.

## Small Group 2
As a group, review the weekly assessment - try to identify a few differences between your implementations.  You can use the following prompts as a starting point:

* Share each of your explanations of what a *class* is (Exercise 5)
* Compare your implementation of Exercise 3 - did anyone have a different implementation, or did you all make the same changes?
* Compare your implementations of the method `book.Summary()` - did anyone in your group use a `for` loop?

As you review your code, come up with at least 2 questions you still have.  Choose one person in your group to send these questions to your instructors via slack DM.

** Instructors ** after gathering questions, identify a few key pieces to review.  You may also want to followup with groups individually.

<!-- I like how we are using the CFUs in conjunction with the review time - excited to see how they work together in reality! Do you have a sense of how much time will be dedicated to group work vs. whole group review? -->
