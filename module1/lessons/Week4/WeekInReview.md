# Week 4 Review Guide

** Instructor Note **  For this review, the CFU question portion is a bit shorter, so we will have 3 small groups.  Small group 1.5 could be pairs of the group 1 groups.

## Small Group 1
In small groups (3/4 students), work through these these [Checks For Understanding](/Mod1/Lessons/Week4/CFUReview.md) questions that cover each of this week's lessons.  Make a note of any questions or topics that are unclear - instructors will be moving around break-out rooms helping to clarify tricky topics.  If you need an instructor, use the raise hand ✋ feature.

In your group, nominate 1 'spokesperson' to take the lead on sharing your group's responses in the next section.

** Instructor Note **
As you move through different groups, keep a list of topics that need to be addressed for the larger group.

### Small Group 1.5
You will pair up with another group to compare your Checks for Understanding responses.  This week, there is a lot of room for variation - this is a great opportunity to see different ways of approaching the same question/problem!  Before starting your comparisons, name one person in this large group to be a 'time keeper' to keep an eye on the time, and keep the conversation moving.


## Small Group 2
As a group, review the weekly assessment - try to identify a few differences between your implementations.  You can use the following prompts as a starting point:

* Discuss the different benefits of testing you each came up with.
* List the methods that you all tested on the Vehicle class - did you all test the same things?
* Compare the tests that you wrote - share your screens and ask questions!

As you review your code, come up with at least 2 questions you still have.  Choose one person in your group to send these questions to your instructors via slack DM.

** Instructors ** after gathering questions, identify a few key pieces to review.  You may also want to followup with groups individually.
