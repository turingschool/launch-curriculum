# Week 1 Review Guide

## Small Group 1
In small groups (3/4 students), work through these these [Checks For Understanding](/Mod1/Lessons/Week2/CFUReview.md) questions that cover each of this week's lessons.  Make a note of any questions or topics that are unclear - instructors will be moving around break-out rooms helping to clarify tricky topics.  If you need an instructor, use the raise hand âœ‹ feature.

** Instructor Note **
As you move through different groups, keep a list of topics that need to be addressed for the larger group.

## Small Group 2
As a group, review the weekly assessment - try to identify a few differences between your implementations.  You can use the following prompts as a starting point:

* 
* 
* "One difference I see between Megan's implementation and a way I thought about the code is ____"

As you review your code, come up with at least 2 questions you still have.  Choose one person in your group to send these questions to your instructors via slack DM.

** Instructors ** after gathering questions, identify a few key pieces to review.  You may also want to followup with groups individually.
