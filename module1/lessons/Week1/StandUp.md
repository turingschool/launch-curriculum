# Daily Stand-Up Meeting

## What x Why

The Daily Stand-up Meeting is a fundamental part of agile development. Think of a stand-up as an opportunity to huddle with your team in order to stay informed and connected throughout a *sprint*.

We will work on our ability to contribute to and report out of daily stand-up meetings throughout the Launch program. This exercise will give you a jumpstart on other new hires when you begin your first job after Turing!

### Wait, what is a *sprint*?

A **sprint** is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. For now, you can consider each week as a *sprint* within a module.

## General Outline

Here is an outline for each stand-up meeting:

1. **Yesterday**: 
  * What did I accomplish yesterday?
  * Did I work independently or with a teammate?
  * What is the name of the teammate I worked with?
2. **Today**: 
  * What do I plan to accomplish today?
  * Will I work independently or with a teammate? 
  * What is the name of the teammate I plan to work with?
3. **Blockers**:
  * Do you have any blockers impeding your work today or longer-term?
  * These blockers could be personal or work-related. 
  * You do not need to divulge your personal business in a stand-up. The times you will be available will suffice.

### Example Stand-up Meeting

* **Yesterday**: I used pgAdmin to create the database for my project and wrote an SQL script to populate the tables. I worked with Megan to make sure my SQL syntax was correct.
* **Today**: I plan to review the lesson on Unit Testing so I can begin testing my application. I also need to complete the lab from Monday.
* **Blockers**: I have a dentist appointment at 12:15pm. I should be back by 1:00pm, but I may be a few minutes late in my return.

## Expectations for Stand-Ups
* Stand-up meetings happen first thing in the morning. For us, that means **Monday through Thursday, 9:00am MT sharp**. Remember that attendance is taken every day, so make every effort to arrive EARLY so that youâ€™ll ensure you are ON-TIME.
  * In the event that we cannot have a live stand-up meeting, we will have an async stand-up via Slack. An instructor will create a thread in the cohort channel, and you will reply to the thread with your stand-up responses.
* Be prepared with a response for each question above before the meeting starts. This will allow you to convey your answers concisely and accurately.
* Be specific with your accomplishments. For example, _"I created the database for my project and wrote a script to populate the tables"_ is better than _"I worked on my project"_.
* Oftentimes, one group member will be responsible for capturing the notes from the standup. You can create a simple Google document or spreadsheet to accomplish this. 
* Make a copy of [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1plk7cegfcio7skNZ68p2_4ZH3OZh77wBkanuzrmTGYw/copy) to log your personal daily stand-up entries to keep yourself on task.
