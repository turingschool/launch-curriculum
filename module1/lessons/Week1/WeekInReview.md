## Small Group 1
In small groups (3/4 students), work through these [Checks For Understanding](./CFUReview.md) questions that cover each of this week's lessons.  Make a note of any questions or topics that are unclear - instructors will be moving around break-out rooms helping to clarify tricky topics.  If you have a question and an instructor is not currently in your room - post your question in your cohort's slack channel!

* The trickiest part of the assessment was...
* I determined if a user wanted to play the game by...

As you review your code, come up with at least 2 questions you still have.  Choose one person in your group to send these questions to your instructors via slack DM.
