# Week 1 Review Guide

## Small Group 1
In small groups (3/4 students), work through these [Checks For Understanding](/Mod1/Lessons/Week1/CFUReview.md) questions that cover each of this week's lessons.  Make a note of any questions or topics that are unclear - instructors will be moving around break-out rooms helping to clarify tricky topics.  If you need an instructor, use the raise hand âœ‹ feature.

** Instructor Note **
As you move through different groups, keep a list of topics that need to be addressed for the larger group.

## Small Group 2
As a group, review the weekly assessment - try to identify a few differences between your implementations.  You can use the following prompts as a starting point:

* 

As you review your code, come up with at least 2 questions you still have.  Choose one person in your group to send these questions to your instructors via slack DM.

** Instructors ** after gathering questions, identify a few key pieces to review.  You may also want to followup with groups individually.

<!-- Review Notes
- I think that having students go back through the Check for Understanding questions is a really good way to have students go back to the lessons. One thing I've been learning about in the book I'm reading is having students do more active recall by quizzing themselves on the material they've learned. I wonder if we compiled all of the Check for Understanding questions into a quiz of sorts and students work in groups to come up with answers together and quiz one another. Obviously this would require some really strong norm setting, but could go a long way in helping solidify the material, normalize making mistakes, and help with student collaboration. Yep, love this idea!
- Do "solution" and "implementation" essentially mean the same thing? If so, I feel like "solution" connotates more along the lines of "right vs wrong" wheras implementation seems more neutral. Probably nitpicking here but just want us thinking about how the language we use/choose connotates meaning + creates/erodes inclusive environments. Totally agree, in this case solution does mean implementation.
- Overall, I think we need to be really explicit in our instructions to students, especially in the first few mods. When giving instructions, I think if we write things in a more structured way/more of a recipe-style, it will reduce the mental overhead for students and make it easier for folks to be on the samep page. For example, just saying "Identify differences between your solutions..." might be too open ended for a brand new student who likely feels totally overwhelmed haha. I wonder if we could provide more scaffolding around HOW to look at a particular question/code problem and HOW to start talking about these observations. For example, giving students a set of questions/form that walks through the different parts of the assessment so they aren't all over the place. Also,  Things like sentence starters could be really useful for new students to help with structurre and articulation, such as:
  - "When I look at Line # in the code, I notice..."
  - "When I look at lines X-xx, I think the code will do ____"
  - "One difference I see between Megan's implementation and a way I thought about the code is ____"
  - ** I would love to brainstorm on different sentence starters we could use throughout lessons, mods, etc. **
  - How do you envsion breaking down the time in review between small group and whole group? -->
