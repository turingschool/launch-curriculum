# Daily Wrap-Up Meeting

## What x Why

The Daily Wrap-Up Meeting is an opportunity to meet with your Instructors and the entire cohort at the end of each day. This meeting will be held **Monday through Wednesday, 3:45pm MT**.

## Summary

In general, the following are covered in the Daily Wrap-Up:

* Overview of deliverables due that day
* The relationship of the day's lesson or lab to a larger deliverable (i.e. the mod Project)
* Q&A for lessons and labs covered on that day or related to those lessons and labs
* Q&A for any outstanding issues
  * Note: if a question requires a lengthy response or any outside research, we will likely make a note to answer it the next day or via Slack.
* Overview of the next cohort day. This will differ based on the weekday:
  * Monday/Tuesday: Lessons and labs for the next day
  * Wednesday: Weekly review, assessment, synthesis, retro; Office hours or Instructor check-ins
  * Note: the Daily Wrap-Up is replaced by the Weekly Retro on Thursday.

This meeting is less structured than the Daily Stand-Up meeting, but not less important. This meeting provides valuable intel for the entire cohort and sets the tone for the next day.
