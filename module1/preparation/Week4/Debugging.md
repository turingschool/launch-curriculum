## Preparation

Tomorrow, we are going to be discussing **debugging**.  Spend 5-10 minutes googling to come up with a definition of **debugging**; you could try phrases like `what is a bug in programming?`, `debugging code`, `c# debugging tools` and `Where did the term bug come from in programming?`.  
In your notebook, write out your definition of debugging. Write down some examples of real life debugging you might have already had experience with.
