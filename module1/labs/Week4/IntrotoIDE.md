# Lab
Lab time is designed for you to prepare for upcoming lessons, and practice what you have learned so far.  Both aspects are important for your success.  During this time, you are encouraged to collaborate with fellow students, and reach out to instructors with any and all questions!

** Instructor Note ** We are going to ask students to do some written reflection during today's lab. As you circulate among students, Be sure to check that students are doing this reflection (not just jumping right into code!).  
Before the lab: create groups of 2-3 students and post them in slack!  The students will get into these groups to psuedo-code 'Fizz Buzz'

## Lab Objectives
* Practice coding using the Visual Studio IDE
* Implement a common code challenge using loops

## Practice

Today, we explored how to write code using Visual Studio.  This is where we will do _most_ of our work from now on, so it's a good idea to get really comfortable with this tool.

### Process Review

1. Create a new `Console Application` in Visual Studio. Name your solution 'FizzBuzz'.
As you create this new application, in your notebook write down the steps you are taking - be as specific as possible!

2. Once your application is created, use Console.WriteLine() to print a message to the console.
Again, in your notebook write down what you do to accomplish this task.

3. In your notebook, write a reflection of what is different about this Visual Studio process from what we were previously doing in REPLit.  What is different about creating a project?  Are there differences in how the applications are run?

**Keep an eye on Slack** We will be coming together to discuss your reflections!

### FizzBuzz

There are a few common programming 'problems' that you will hear about over and over - they might be used for interview questions, or as an example of syntax for other programming languages.  One of these problems is called 'FizzBuzz' and it goes like this:

```
FizzBuzz

Your task is to print integers 1 to 100.  
If a number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'.
If a number is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'.
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'.

For example:
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 
11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz...
```

1. In small groups, take 10-15 minutes to pseudocode an implementation of 'FizzBuzz' - it will probably be helpful to use one or more of the methods we learned in the [Looping](/Mod1/Lessons/Week2/Looping.md) lesson 😉.  Use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to collaborate on the pseudocoding - send the collaboration link to your instructor, as well!
** Instructor Note ** Show a quick (1min) demo of how to use and collaborate with Excalidraw.

<!-- I think we should be more explicit on WHERE/HOW we want students to pseudocode a solution. I wonder if there are some common collaborative whiteboarding tools we could use to have students practice this habit? Even if we go a more basic route, I think we could still be more clear like "Have one team member write your steps in a Slack message and be prepared to send to a thread when notified by an instructor." I think the more we can come back to pseudocoding/hold students accountable to do it, the more likely they will actually use it as a strategy to help them with problem solving -->

2. Individually, In the 'FizzBuzz' Solution you created above, implement your psuedo-code!

3. There are multiple ways to solve this problem - your instructor is going to pair you with someone (or a group of someones) who approached the problem in a different way.  In that group, discuss the following:
    * Each person will do a walkthrough of their code and psuedo-code - share your screen and describe what is happening on each line of code, and describe how that is similar or different to what you psuedo-coded.
    <!-- It might be good idea to have them share pseudocode first too?  -->
    * Discuss which parts of the project were difficult, or didn't work as expected.  Did you come accross any errors? If so, how did you fix them?
    * As a group, come up with three benefits of using Visual Studio to write this code.  As you brainstorm, you might think about what tools Visual Studio has, or how you could (or could not) execute the program in an application like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
    * Nominate 1 person to share out 1 interesting thing your group discussed.


**Keep an eye on Slack** We will be coming together to discuss your reflections!

<!-- I am really excited to see how this lab works! I like how it blends some exploration with a new tool (VS) while reinforcing concepts from previous lesosns. I think the temptation will be to focus mostly on the implementation of FizzBuzz, but we need to ensure we maintain a strong focus on the learning goals of utilziing an IDE. -->

<!-- Speaking of learning goals, I wonder if students AND instructors would benefit from having 1-2 learning goals associated with each lab? I can imagine as we get into trickier content it may be difficult for students to know EXACTLY what the focus of the lab should be - do you want to take a stab at adding 1-2 learning goals for each lab moving forward? -->

## Preparation

Tomorrow, we are going to be discussing **debugging**.  Spend 5-10 minutes googling to come up with a definition of **debugging**; you could try phrases like `what is a bug in programming?`, `debugging code`, `c# debugging tools`.  In your notebook, write out your definition of debugging.
