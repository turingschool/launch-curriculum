This weekly assessment is an opportunity for you to explore the main learning goals from the week.  If there are any topics that are unclear, now is the time to reach out for additional information and assistance!

During this assessment, you may use any resource other than fellow students.  Feel free to google, look back at your notes, lessons, etc...

## Questions and Exercises (10 Points Total)

We will be using REPLit for this assessment so that instructors can provide line-by-line feedback.

**Fork** [This REPL](https://replit.com/@launch-team/Week2AssessmentQuestions?v=1) and complete the questions and exercises it contains.  Each question or exercise is indicated by a single line comment prompt like this: `// This is a single line comment that gives instructions` followed by a multiline comment where you will complete the exercise: `/* < these are the multiline comment indicators > */`.  For the exercises, you can verify they are working by removing the multiline comments and running the program.

When completed, click the `Invite` button in the upper right corner. Click the `Private join link` switch, then click the `Copy join link` button to copy the link. Paste this link in the submission form for the **Questions and Exercises REPL** response.

## Build a Guessing Game (10 points)

We are going to be expanding on a Guessing Game similar to the one we created in last week's assessment.  So that we are all starting from the same point, **fork** [this REPL](https://replit.com/@launch-team/Week2AssessmentPractical) and update the game based on the following instructions:

1. Update the game so that a user gets more specific feedback if their answer is incorrect.  If they guess a number that is too high or too low, the output should be `No, that number is too high!` or `... to low!`. If they guess a number that is outside of the range of 1 - 100, the output should be `That guess is out of range.  The number I'm thinking of is between 1 and 100`.

1. Now, update the game so that continues to ask the user to guess, until they have guessed the correct number.  Users should still get feedback on if their guess is high, low, or out of range.

1. Keep track of how many guesses it takes the user, and let them know how many guesses it takes to get the correct answer.

1. If a user takes more than 15 guesses, the game should end.

### Rubric

This assessment has a total of **20 Points**.  Earning **10 or more** points is a **pass** and will indicate that you are progressing well with the material. We will give feedback on the version at the time the assessment ends. Please do not update your repls after that time, if you want to keep practicing you can always make a new copy for yourself.

As a reminder, this assessment is for students and instructors to determine if there are any areas that need additional reinforcement!
