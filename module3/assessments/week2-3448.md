title: Week 2 Assessment

From this assessment on, we would like you to edit your markdown files in Visual Studio instead of Github. This will help avoid merge conflicts and it's nice to work on everything in one place. 

There is a great Visual Studio Extension for editing markdown! Let's all install the extension [Markdown Editor 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.MarkdownEditor2) now. After installing, you will need to fully close out of Visual Studio. With this extension, every time you open a markdown file the preview window should open as well.

[Follow the instructions on this repo!](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/Launch_3448)
