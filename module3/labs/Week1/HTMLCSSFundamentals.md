## FlexBox

CSS Flexbox is a powerful layout module that provides a flexible way to arrange and align elements within a container, enabling developers to create responsive and dynamic web designs. With Flexbox, elements can be organized in a row or column, adjusting their sizes and positions to fit the available space. Its intuitive set of properties, such as flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items, offer fine-grained control over the layout, making it ideal for building complex, yet adaptable, interfaces. Whether you need to create a responsive grid, a centered navigation bar, or a flexible card layout, CSS Flexbox provides a versatile and efficient solution for modern web development.
