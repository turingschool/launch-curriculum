## Recreating Comps

We are going to be practicing our HTML and CSS skills by re-creating images of web-pages.

## Setup
* Fork this [starter repl](https://replit.com/@launch-team/staticchallenges#index.html)
    * The content for the page is in `site_copy.md`
    * All images are included in the `images` directory
* Choose one of the Comp Images to recreate from below.
* Update the `index.html` and `stylesheets/main.css` files to recreate one of the images below.
    * Use at least 5 html tags
    * Use at least 2 classes
    * Use at least 2 ids
    * make sure to use semantic html tags!

## Submission
* At the end of the lab, drop a link to your forked repl in the slack thread your instructor will start!
