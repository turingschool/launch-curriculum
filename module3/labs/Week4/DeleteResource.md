
For the lab: Brainstorm ways to make MVC movies more user friendy and then implement a link from this main table to the details and edit pages. And maybe a link to New somewhere on the main page. And maybe we figure out what to do with the nav bar at the top?

* No typing in URLs, and no typing the back button

Maybe we make a list of things in slack and instructor can put spicy peppers next to the most complicated level ups. 

Spicy: In the title it says - MVC Movies. It's supposed to have the page before that. For example, Reviews - MVCMovie. Can you figure out what is setting that?
Spicy: 

Presentations:

Maybe call on each group to give a short demo/presentation of one thing they improved. 

What is the feature request? (draw it out!)
What was your process for figuring out how to fix it? Were there any things you tried along the way?
What was your final result?

Everyone push their code to github, have they cloned MVC movies? I think yes.
