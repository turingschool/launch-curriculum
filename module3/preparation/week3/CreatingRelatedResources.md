## Understanding Forms

Imagine we have an application that tracks vehicles and their owners.  A Vehicle belongs to an Owner, and an Owner can have many Vehicles.

1. What attributes would an Owner have?
1. What would the form to create an Owner look like?
    * psuedo-code the form in your notebook
    * make sure to include labels, inputs, and submission route!

    * psuedo-code the form in your notebook
    * make sure to include labels, inputs, and submission route!
    * How will you indicate which owner the vehicle belongs to?
