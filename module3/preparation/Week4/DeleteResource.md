# Pre-work for [Deleting Resources](/module3/lessons/Week4/DeleteResource)

In our next lesson, we are going to be using our MvcMovies application to delete Movie and Review records.

## Diagram HTTP Request/Response for Delete

In your notebook:

* Diagram the HTTP request/response for deleting a movie

Make sure that your diagrams include the HTTP Path, Verb, and any additional information you can think of for the requests! Include as much detail as you can about the response! It's ok if there are some things you're unsure of here, we'll share our diagrams and discuss them at the start of the lesson.

## Review CSS

As part of our Deleting Resource Lesson, we're going to add some styling to our MVC Movies app. To prepare, review the CSS lesson.
