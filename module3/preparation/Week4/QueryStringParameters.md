## Pre-Work for [Query String Parameters](/module3/lessons/Week4/QueryStringParameters)

In tomorrow's lesson, we're going to add additional tools for passing information between a `View` and a `Controller`. To prepare for that lesson, refresh yourself on [MVC](/module3/lessons/Week2/IntroToMVC).

While reviewing MVC, write down as much information as you can in response to the following questions. 

Based on what we have built so far in Mod 3....
 * How do the `View` and `Controller` interact?
    * How do `path parameters` allow us to pass information from the `View` to the `Controller`?
 * How do the `Controller` and `Model` interact?
 * How do the `View` and `Model` interact?

 We will start tomorrow's lesson by reviewing these questions together.
