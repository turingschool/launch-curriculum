## Pre-Work for Creating a Single Resource

### Independent Learning: HTML Forms

I don't think we will have covered forms yet, so I think this fits well as the preparation.

Maybe I include a screenshot of a form here and then give students the goal of recreating it?

* What HTML elements are a part of forms? 
* What is the purpose of the Label element?
* Can you find any best practices for form accessibility? //Maybe too much of a stretch but forms are such a good place to bring in accessibility.
