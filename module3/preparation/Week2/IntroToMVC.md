* In your own words, what is a Controller?
* In your own words, what is a View?

* What is the benefit of using MVC?

Start by reading the ASP.NET official MVC documentation: 
* [Overview of MVC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

Then take some time to learn from other resources too. Here are two to get you started:
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/article/mvc)
* [ðŸŽ¦Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUg2SWWK18I)
