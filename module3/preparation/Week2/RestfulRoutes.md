title: RESTful Routes Preparation
---

In the RESTful Routes lesson, we will build off of what we learned in the How the Web Works lesson and start to build our own routes!

To prepare, start by reviewing [How The Web Works](/module3/lessons/Week1/HowTheWebWorks).


<section class="call-to-action" markdown="1">
## Deliverable
Be prepared to share during the lesson your answers to the following questions:
* What is CRUD?
* What is an HTTP route?
* What is a RESTful route?
* What are the parts of a URL?
* What is REST?
* What are the seven RESTful routes?

You will need to use your research skills for some of these questions!
