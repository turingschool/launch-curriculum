## Learning Goals

- Implement a calendar system
- Plan a routine to increase time awareness

## Time Management at Turing

Turing is a full-time, immersive program. You are going to learn the technical and professional skills needed to succeed in demanding, yet high-paying technical careers in less than a year.

For the Launch program, we estimate students work an **average of 40-50 hours per week** at Turing; some weeks with fewer hours, some weeks with more hours. While at Turing, **time** is your most valuable commodity. How you use your time will be a determining factor in your overall success in the program.

<div class="s-card">
  <h3>40-55 hours per week</h3>
  <p>In whatever way makes most sense to you, visualize what 40-50 hours per week would look like on a daily basis.</p>
  <p>Think about the details of that "daily" life. If you said you'd work ~8 hours/day - what do you do with your other 16 hours? How do you plan in time to eat? How many hours are allotted to sleep? When do you grocery shop? Spend time with family? Walk the dogs? And - whatever else is important or essential to you?</p>
  <p>Jot down notes about this if you'd like; you don't need to submit anything for this specific prompt, but it should help you get in the right frame of mind for the rest of this activity.</p>

### Calendaring

One strategy we’ve seen our most successful students employ is using some type of calendar system to track, manage and plan their time while in the program. A few key notes:

- Calendaring is a very difficult skill to master - you will need to commit to practicing it in order to improve.
- Find a calendar tool and stick with it. Everyone’s system, calendar tool, etc. might be a little different, but those who don't use any tool typically struggle with time management while at Turing. We **strongly recommend** you use Google Calendar for two reasons: it's what we use at Turing and it is a very popular tool in the industry, so it is good to practice using it now.
- Calendars are meant to be **living documents** that can change. You can’t plan for everything, and sometimes we don’t accurately estimate how long something will take. Being able to make adjustments to calendars as things change is a very important skill to start practicing. This is another reason a digital tool like Google Calendar is helpful - it's super easy to adjust things as needed.

### Time Management and Calendar Tips from Successful Students

- **Purposefully build in scheduled time for health, wellness and whatever else you need to be your best self.** If you don’t plan for it, chances are it won’t happen. Turing moves fast, but it is still a marathon. How can you make sure you are creating a sustainable schedule/routine? If you are working part-time, be sure to block that time off as well! 
- **Color coding can be your friend.** Choose different colors for Turing-related and Life-related tasks. This way you can get a quick glimpse of how well you are finding balance between these two competing priorites. 
- **Break down time blocks as much as possible.** Anything over an hour will usually be unproductive and give too much time to procrastinate. Additionally, on each calendar event, name the specific task you expect you to complete in that time. If you don't finish or something else takes longer, you just move that block instead of losing your tasks. It’s like a task list and a calendar in one!
- **Avoid context-shifting too frequently.** On the flip side, don’t break down your blocks too much. For example, trying to cram 4-5 different tasks into a single hour is also not productive and can be extremely exhausting.
- **Treat your blocks of time as appointments that shouldn’t be missed.** You wouldn’t miss an appointment with a manager; treat your other blocks the same way, even for independent work or study time.
- **When you think of something you need to do, put it on your calendar immediately.** For example, if after a lesson, you think to yourself “I really want to go back and finish that activity we started in the lesson…” you should immediately pull up your calendar, find a 15-30 minute block of time in the next couple of days and make an event for working on that particular exercise (and add the link to the lesson and/or exercise to that event).
- **Reflect on your time management each week.** Build in time each week to reflect on how well you stuck to your schedule. Be gracious to yourself and adjust the upcoming week.
- **Time management becomes more important throughout the program.** As the program progresses, you will find yourself balancing more responsibilities, such as attacking the technical curriculum while simultaneously searching for your first software developer job.

## Mod 1

In Mod 1, you'll be expected to be available and fully engaged between the hours of 9am-12pm and 1pm-4pm MT, Monday-Thursday (excluding any holidays Turing observes). During those times, you'll be in live, whole-group classes, possibly in small-group sessions led by instructors, and some of that time will be structured work time with teammates, check-ins or evaluations with instructors.

In addition to those specific hours, most students spend additional time outside of formal class time to study/practice on their own, review material for the upcoming day, or go back to work on labs and projects. About 70% of the projects assigned are collaborative; meaning you will not be working independently (with only your brain and your _schedule_), but will need to find times to work with your teammates. Sometimes, this will mean compromising. However, it's important to have some clear boundaries for your self-care.

When it comes to the way they spend their time, there are two major pitfalls we see students fall into, that result in them burning out and usually repeating Mod 1:
1. Not dedicating any time to their personal needs: scheduling seven 14-hour days of coding a week.
1. Underestimating the commitment and then being very disappointed when they don't have time to do things they enjoy (play guitar for 3 hours a day, work a part-time job, go to Happy Hour several evenings a week, or go skiing every weekend).

Since each Mod is only 6 weeks long, if you fall behind by one week, it can be really hard to catch up. Having a proactive and realistic plan is the best way to set yourself up for success
