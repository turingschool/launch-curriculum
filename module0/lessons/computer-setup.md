### Install Slack

Slack is our main communication tool at Turing. **You will receive an invitation to join the Turing Workspace 2 weeks before your Mod 0 start date**. If you are not familiar with it, it may seem overwhelming at first. There are a lot of tips and tricks you'll pick up along the way.

**Action Steps:**
- [Download and install the Slack desktop application](https://slack.com/downloads/windows)

To ensure that you are prepared for your first session:
- Watch the [Slack Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfq333EpWgM).

- It's a good idea to get in the habit of checking Slack daily starting now.

### Create a GitHub Account

GitHub is a widely used platform that hosts code projects and allows for collaborative workflows. You will spend a lot of time on this site and become fluent in using it as a tool.

**Action Steps:**
- [Create an account on GitHub](https://github.com/). Please use your Turing email address.
- [Update your GitHub Profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) and be sure that you choose a username, status, profile info, and picture that are appropriate for a professional setting. GitHub is a platform where future/potential employers will be reviewing your work.
- Bookmark the GitHub webpage on Chrome so that you can easily find it again later. [Here's how to create bookmarks in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop).

<br>

### Create a Replit Account

[Replit](https://replit.com/~) provides an online platform that allows us to write code and see the results almost immediately - all inside of one browser tab! There are many other similar (and awesome) tools available but replit is used regularly in Mods 1 and 2, so Mod 0 provides an introduction and some exposure.

Follow the steps below (if they are not necessary because you have already done them or have experience with replit, you can skip this):
- Create a free account using your Turing email address.
- Bookmark the Replit webpage on Chrome so that you can easily find it again later. [Here's how](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop).
- [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnLE3bH6fHE) to learn how to navigate the interface and create new projects.

### Create a Trello Account

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a Kanban-style project management tool we will use in Mod 0. It and other similar tools are used by most software developers to manage the tasks within a project.

- Please create a free account with Trello using your Turing email address.
- Bookmark the Trello webpage on Chrome so that you can easily find it again later. [Here's how](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop).
- Create a copy of your program's Mod 0 Trello board by following the steps below:
  1. Open the [Launch Mod 0 Trello Board]() to get started. *need link*
  1. In the upper right corner, select the `...Show menu` button.
  1. Select `... More` about halfway down the side menu.
  1. Select `Copy board` and create a name for your personalized Trello board. This board will now be saved on your personal Trello account.

<br>

### Create a Loom Account

[Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is a free online video tool that allows you to create instantly shareable videos. With Loom, you can record your camera, microphone, and desktop simultaneously. You will be required to submit videos throughout Mod 0 as part of the coursework. Although you can use other tools to accomplish the same goal, we strongly recommend using Loom as it is extremely user-friendly.

- Please create a free account with Loom using your Turing email address.
- Bookmark the Loom webpage on Chrome so that you can easily find it again later. [Here's how](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/188842?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop).
- If you've never used Loom before, [watch this video](https://youtu.be/iugmJe8uDLE) to familiarize yourself with this tool.

### Install Zoom

Zoom is the primary tool for classroom time, study halls, and community building at Turing.

**Action Steps:**
- [Download and install Zoom](https://zoom.us/download/).
- If you haven't already, create an account with Zoom.
- [Update your name in your profile](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363203-My-Profile) following this pattern: First Name, Last Initial, pronouns, Program - `Megan M (she/her), Launch`.
- [Learn how to raise your hand](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205566129-Raise-Hand-In-Webinar).
- Give your Zoom account the following permissions: screen sharing, microphone, camera.

### Snap your Windows

Windows 11 offers a feature to position multiple windows on the screen. Known as Snap Windows, this feature lets you precisely control how and where a window is located by selecting a predefined layout. By snapping each window into a specific place on your desktop, you can more easily juggle multiple windows.

The best part is that there's nothing to install! [Learn more about Snap Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241) and practice arranging windows on your screen using different layout configurations.

## That's all folks! 
To verify that all steps are completed and installations are working as expected, complete the steps below. If you do not get the expected output for any of the following steps, go back to that step in the computer setup and carefully follow all of the steps a second time. 
1. Quit out of all other applications and close any extra Chrome windows. You can verify that Chrome is running by looking at your dock at the bottom of your screen. The active application (Chrome) will have a gray bar under the icon. Other applications that are currently running will have a small gray dot under each icon.
1. **Chrome:** In your Chrome window, open a new tab. At the very top under the address bar, you should see at least four bookmarked pages, [GitHub](https://www.github.com), [Replit](https://replit.com/~), [Trello](https://trello.com/), and [Loom](https://www.loom.com/looms/videos). Open each bookmark in its own tab. Close each tab by clicking the `X` attached to each tab.
1. **Slack:** To ensure that Slack is installed correctly, open the Windows menu, type `Slack`, then press `Enter`.
    - Your Slack application should open in a new window.
    - Right-click the Slack icon in the taskbar and select `Pin to taskbar`.
    - Quit Slack by holding down `Ctrl + q`. The gray bar under the Slack icon will disappear, but the Slack icon will remain.
1. **Zoom:** To ensure that Zoom is installed correctly, open the Windows menu, type `Zoom`, then press `Enter`.
    - Your Zoom application should open in a new window.
    - Right-click the Zoom icon in the taskbar and select `Pin to taskbar`.
    - Quit Zoom by holding down `Ctrl + q`. The gray bar under the Zoom icon will disappear, but the Zoom icon will remain.


If after re-reading and completing the setup steps a second time, you are still experiencing issues, document the problem with screenshots and reach out for support in your Mod 0 Slack channel!
