Email is a common communication tool across organizations for team-wide communications and communications with external partners, such as clients (people/companies you are writing code for) or vendors (companies that provide a service that you use).

At Turing, you will typically use...
- **Slack** for internal communications, such as collaborating with teammates, getting schoolwide updates, and communicating with your instructors
- **Email** for external communications, such as networking, internship/job applications, outreach to employers, etc.

### Choosing an Email Address
We recommend using/creating a Google Mail address and using that for your external communications

Your email address should:
- Be appropriate / pass the MeeMaw test
- Have some portion of your name

You should have a clear, email signature that includes:
- Your name
- Your preferred contact information
- Links to your relevant sites (LinkedIn, Github, etc.)

### Email Signatures
Your email signature should include:
- Your name
- Your pronouns
- Best phone number to reach you at
- Links to your professional social pages (LinkedIn, Github, etc.)
- We will cover these later in the program!

Your email signature should **NOT** include:
- Your favorite quote
- Multiple colors or different fonts
- An image as your email signature

### A Note About Your @turing.edu Email

As a student at Turing, you have access to a turing.edu email for 2 years! This email can/should be used for obtaining student discounts on various sites

This email should **NOT** be used for:
- External communication with employers or networking opportunities
- Being your main email address - it will expire in 2 years

### Professional Email Habits in M0 + Beyond

We will be diving into more detail how to approach email as a professional, but in the meantime here are some suggestions for M0 and beyond.

- Assume that all written communication (Slack, email, etc.) can be viewed by someone else - be wary of writing something down that youâ€™ll later regret
- Commit to checking your email at a set cadence per day and carving out time to respond to pertinent requests
    - Example: Check email before starting the day, check towards the end of the day to determine if you need to address anything before wrapping up/starting the next day

### Email Review Jam
