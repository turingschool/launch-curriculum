Today is all about returning to your LinkedIn. You will be polishing up your profile and engaging with the broader developer community to make sure your LinkedIn best represent you!

## Careerflow Competition! 

Instructions for all team members:

1. Install the [Careerflow Chrome Extension](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/careerflow-ai-linkedin-op/iadokddofjgcgjpjlfhngclhpmaelnli&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1695826733869948&usg=AOvVaw03e0L95JHMmx0VCrDyAm3g)
2. Go to your Linkedin profile and click the blue box with a “C” in it on the right hand side of the page.
    * It will prompt you to make an account to view suggested improvements.
3. Make the recommended changes to your profile to improve it - you have until lunch on Thursday to make changes
4. Add up the percentages of each team member and average them.

The team spokesperson will DM your instructors with your group’s average score and any bonus points earned (Each bonus point counts as adding a percentage point to your team average!). Average score is due at noon this Thursday!

The team with the highest average overall score will be the winners!

### Bonus Points!

#### Activity

Each teammate who has at least three things in their activity gets one bonus point for their team. 


Take a look at these two example activity feeds. Yours probably looks more like the first screenshot here! But our goal is to show you're activity engaged with the broader developer community and for your activity to look more like Jeff's!

What types of activity could you do that would then show up in this section?

* Comment, like, and repost!
    * Look for content you agree and would want associated with your developer identity you're building.
* Post something! Here is a great list of post types to get you started that Tom shared [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7120815349628895232/)!
    * Nuggets of wisdom: “Today I learned that you can…”

    * Helpful resources: “[Insert resource] is an excellent practice resource for…” 

    * Crowdsourcing: “Does anyone know how to…?”

    * Upcoming events: “Check out the [insert event] happening on Tuesday…”

    * Repost with context: “I highly recommend following [tag person who posts helpful content] for great insights on [insert topic]! For example, check out this recent post:”

    * Milestones: “Excited to be participating in [insert event]...”

[Here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolemgooden/) is a good example of activity from a Turing Grad! [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/landon-spell/recent-activity/all/) is another example of showing quick TIL style content. 

[Here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7110320303892836352/) is a post from Ibotta that I know you all know something about. This is the type of content that would be excellent to interact with!

#### Recommendations

Each teammate who has at least one recommendation on their profile gets one bonus point for their team. 

Honestly, it doesn't so much matter what the recommendation says your future employer probably won't read it, what really has an impact is showing that there is someone out there willing to vouch that you're awesome to work with!

I recommend asking your group mates from your group project to write a review! You have all worked together very closely and can speak about the strengths you brought to the team!
