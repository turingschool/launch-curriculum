title: MVC Maintenance Sprint Project aka "The Level Up Project"
---

## Learning Goals
* Utilize the skills for building a high quality .NET applications in a more open ended environment
* Build familiarity with the maintenance phase of the SDLC
* Handle navigating a new team and codebase

## Output Goal
* An even better project to add to your professional portfolio

## Overview

Over the past week you've all learned many tools to improve the quality of your applications and level up your .NET MVC skills!

These tools include:
* Error Handling and Validation
* Logging
* Refactoring
* Writing Good Documentation

This week you'll have the opportunity to return to your MVC group project from Mod 4 and level up your application by working on a sprint fully focused on "Maintenance"!

What is maintenance, with regards to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?

I really like this explanation from [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-software-maintenance/) post on Geeks for Geeks:

"Software Maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer. This can include fixing bugs, adding new features, improving performance, or updating the software to work with new hardware or software systems. The goal of software maintenance is to keep the software system working correctly, efficiently, and securely, and to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the users.

Software maintenance is a continuous process that occurs throughout the entire life cycle of the software system."

On your future teams, you will probably not spend an entire sprint only on maintenance. Your sprint will probably be a combination of new features and maintenance. [Here](https://www.agilecoachjournal.com/2018-12-18/maintenance-patterns-for-scrum-teams) is further explanation on how that might look like.

But in a class setting, we mainly focus on new features, so for this project we're going all in on maintenance. You will be adding **no new features** only leveling up what's already there. 


## Project Requirements

I'm thinking of requiring at least one implementation of each of the topics covered per team.

* Error Handling and Validation
* Logging
* Refactoring
* Writing Good Documentation

You can also work on tasks related to:
* Fixing bugs
* Making small improvements to the user experience



You have to use git workflow, code review before merging. Unless you did pair programming the entire time.



Proposed Schedule:
Before Day 1: Students do a live user research session with a friend or family member, where they ask someone to try out their application and write down pain points and errors. Is this too much? We have given small assignments to start thinking about the project the weekend before in the past so I think it might fit alright.


Day 1 (With the original team): 
* Define the sprint goals and make tickets (maybe we have a goal of 10 tickets per group), prioritize each issue as low, medium, high priority. 
* Start working

Day 2 (One partner swapped):
* PD Resumes
* Joining a New Team and Codebase
* Work Time

Day 3 (One partner swapped):
* Work Time
* Assessment, better at start of end of day? Maybe the assessment is another project where they need to do some level ups and explain the why behind the decisions they made? Maybe they have to make one refactor, add one instance of error handling, and improve the documentation?

Day 4 (One partner swapped):
* Work Time
* End the day with share outs and retro.
* I'm imagining this isn't a formal presenation but is more a share 2 to 3 improvements you're group is proud of.




## Joining a New Team and Codebase

Here's the sort of out there idea I'd like to try: On Wednesday/Thursday/Monday one person per day (or two one day for the group of three) leaves for another team. 

End of the day they have a written assignment about takeaways, what was hard, what worked, what would they do differently.

We also have a discussion Wednesday before anyone swaps about what the team can do to support someone new and what the swapping person can do. 

Can we make a slack channel for each team that the swapper will join when they swap on?
