title: Sprint Planning
---

## Objectives

* Define the sprint goals and make clear tickets on your project board
    * Shoot for roughly 10-15 tickets per group
* Prioritize each issue as low, medium, high priority

### Improvements Dump (Brainstorm)
* **Objectives**
    * Write out as many potential improvements you could make to your project as possible.
* **Instructions**
    * This is an **individual** activity
    * Each person should write out improvements on Sticky Notes
    * Only 1 improvement per sticky note, make them specific. `Add Error Handling` is insufficient. `Handle null cases in books controller` is better.
    * All potential improvements of the app should be included (we will define what to include in the sprint later in the process)
    * Get creative with potential improvements. There are no wrong answers.

### Improvement Sharing/Elimination of Duplicates (Decide)

* **Objectives**
    * Share what came out of the improvements dump
    * Eliminate duplicate ideas
* **Instructions**
  * You will be organizing these thoughts as a group in the project's Miro board
  * Each person should present their improvements one at a time, giving a *brief* description of what that improvement is, so it is clear for the whole group.
  * As each person takes a turn you will notice that some of the improvements will be duplicates of previously shared improvements. If this is the case, simple delete that sticky note. _Don't spend time describing an improvement if it is a duplicate._

### Improvement Prioritization and Sprint Definition (Decide)

* **Objectives**
    * Define the improvements that will make up your sprint (and maybe some stretch goals)
* **Instructions (recommended)**
    * Go through each improvement and label it as Low/Medium/High Priority
        * Keep in mind the project requirements
        * You can also use an [effort/impact matrix](https://itamargilad.com/why-impact-effort-prioritization-doesnt-work/) to help you determine priority

    * Repeat this process until you have gone through all of the stories.
    * Once you are finished, pick which features you want to add to your sprint, and which you want to leave as stretch goals
    * Add each improvement in your sprint to your team project board. Make sure to include a clear description, someone not in this meeting might be working on that ticket!
