title: Calling An API Mini Project
---

## Learning Goals
* Practice skills of calling an API from a .NET application
* Gain experience navigating vague directions for how to approach the problem

## Overview

For this mini project, you're imagining that you are working on a team with other developers. Your teammate is responsible for building an API for keeping track of a customer's favorite Giphs. Your job is to build the frontend to call your teammates API.

For this project you will be working in pairs and utilizing driver/navigator pair programming.

## The Backend

Clone TODO this repo

## The Frontend - Your Job!

Something about check out the first branch. Build a frontend to make that work, then commit PR, merge into main.

Send repo to instructor.


GET all Giphs

Post form for adding a new giph (similar to lab from yesterday)

Edit form for updating the title or rating.

Spicy stretch goal of adding search where you call the Giphy API?? How would you architect that, then design review?
