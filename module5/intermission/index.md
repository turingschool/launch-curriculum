Before starting Module 5, spend a minimum of 2 hours working through these [PostgreSQL Exercises](https://pgexercises.com/).

You **must** use [this tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCOkwhQEDyPlRIDF2Z9Ff7DvU28aOSX_k0XIML9mnPI/) to keep track of your progress.  Make a copy of the tracker, and rename it so that the title includes your name.

<strong>*Important*</strong>: You will see on the tracker that some exercises are <strong style="color:green;">required</strong> and some are <strong style="color:orange;">recommended</strong>.  You are expected to complete **all** of the required exercises.

âœ…When you have completed the required exercises, send a link to your tracker to all instructors!
