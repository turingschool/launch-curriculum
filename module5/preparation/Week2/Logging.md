## Pre-work for [Logging](/module5/lessons/Week2/Logging)

For tomorrow's lesson, we're going to work on the skill of self-directed learning. So instead of your instructors giving you the questions to research, you're going to come up with the questions!

## Logging Questions

Imagine that you are in your first job and you get assigned the following task, "Add logging to our MVC Movies application."

What questions should you figure out the answers to before you even think about how to write the code to make this happen?

The most obvious question is probably "What is Logging?".

Deliverableâœ…: Brainstorm at least 3 more questions, and be prepared to share them with your peers at the start of the lesson.

No need to research answers to your questions.

    <p><strong>Instructor Note</strong><br>
    Other possible questions could be: Why do we use logging? What should I log? Where do these logs go? Is logging already a part of .NET or is it some other tool I'll need to learn?</p>
