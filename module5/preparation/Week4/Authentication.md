# Prep

## What is Authorization and Authentication?

Research on your own to answer the following questions:
* What are the differences between authentication and authorization?
* What are roles? And, how are 'roles' used in authorization?

## Brainstorm

You are tasked with designing authentication and authorization for a Library application build in ASP.NET Core MVC.  How would you use the tools that we have learned so far to accomplish:
* Librarians should be able to add books.
* Librarians should be able to check out books.
* Users with a library card should be able to check out books.
* Users should be able to see all books that are available to check out.
