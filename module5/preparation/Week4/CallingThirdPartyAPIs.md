title: Calling Third Party APIs Prep
---

### Review
Review what we did when we [built our own APIs](https://launch.turing.edu/module4/lessons/Week2/BuildAnAPI), specifically focus on GET and POST requests.

### Research
At the start of tomorrow's lesson we are also going to talk briefly about asynchronous vs synchronous code and the keywords `Async` and `Await`.

To prepare for that discussion, research the following questions and be prepared to share your answers:

* What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?
* What do the keywords `Async` and `Await` do in C#?
