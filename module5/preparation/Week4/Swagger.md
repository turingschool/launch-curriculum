title: Swagger API Documentation Prep
---

As part of this week's Calling an API Mini Project, you will be learning about a new tool called [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).

Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txArM31my9M) video to get an introduction to Swagger API Documentation.

Feel free do also do some independent research. Swagger is a broad tool that can have a lot of uses, we are focusing on it's ability to create API documentation and an interactive environment for calling an API, as shown in the video.

Be prepared to share answers to the following questions:

* Why would someone use Swagger API Documentation?

    <p><strong>Instructor Note</strong><br>
    We want students to have the key takeaways that it's easily created documentation for someone new to understand your API endpoints without having to dig into the code. We also want them to understand it's an easy way to test calling the API, similarly to Postman but with less set up. </p>
</aside>

* What questions to you have about Swagger?
