title: SOLID Design Principles and Refactoring Patterns
---

## Learning Goals
* Be able to name the SOLID design principles
* Explore a few refactoring patterns
* Understand that there are _many_ more refactoring patterns

## SOLID

* Maybe a gallery Walk
* Maybe groups of 5 learn and present to each other
* Whole group synthesis with key points for instructors to hit
    * Maybe an additional doc with c# examples

## Refactoring Patterns
### Extract Method
* Break up a long method (S)

### Extract Interfaces
* Create small, specific interfaces (O, I)

### Move Method
* move methods to appropriate classes (S)

## Checks for Understanding
