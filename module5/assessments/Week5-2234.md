## Lightning Talk (8 points)

Imagine you are invited to interview for a job - you have been asked to give a lightning talk (up to 5 minutes) on one of the Four Pillars of OOP.  Specifically, you will be assigned either **Encapsulation** or **Polymorphism**.

You will have 75 minutes to research your topic and prepare for your lightning talk.  Then, you will be paired with someone who had a different topic, and the two of you will have 15 minutes to present your talks to each other.  Make sure to **record your presentation** for submission!

We will be assessing these presentations on:
* Information: did you accurately represent your topic?
* Engagement: was this a good experience as an audience member?

## Reflection Question (4 points)

In your submission, include a reflection on this experience.  Make sure to address the following:
* How did past experiences influence your presentation today?
* If given the same assignment next week, what would you do differently?

## Submission

âœ…Submit your video and your reflections in a Slack DM to your instructors!
