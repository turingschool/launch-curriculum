Topics:
* Error Handling
* Logging
* ?Diving back into stale topics?
    * API Endpoints
    * SQL

## Code Review
Review some code: In an interview situation, what are 5 suggestions you would make that would improve the code clarity or function. We are looking for suggestions based on Logging **and** Error Handling. Other suggestions are welcome, but make sure you cover those two topics at a minimum.
    * What would you change and why
        * Include an examplar so that students can see what we are looking for.
    * Identify opportunities based on Error Handling
        * controller that needs to check for null
    * Identify opportunities based on Logging
        * Inadequate logging - it is set up but needs to be better. the log could be: 'you are here' or 'logging the controller. It needs more information.
        * Mismatched log types.

Let's do both MVC and API example (more/same amount so that students could pass with MVC only); Like 5 for MVC, 2 for API _or similar_
