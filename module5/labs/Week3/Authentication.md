title: Authentication Lab

In today's lab, there are 2 tracks.  You may complete the tracks in any order.

<section class='call-to-action' markdown='1'>

## Track 1: Experiment with Identity Scaffolding

When we initially implemented the Identity scaffolding, we chose to override _all_ of the login related pages in the **Add Identity** Dialog.  Some of these pages are not necessary.  Your task is to experiment with which of these pages you want to include, or not.

For each experiment:
* Create a new ASP.NET MVC application (you will not need a database).
* Try a new combination of pages to override at this step of the scaffolding.

* Keep track of what combo you are using, and keep notes about how this selection impacted your application!

✅Send an overview of your experiments and their result to your instructors. Be sure to include which files you chose to override for each experiment (a screenshot is great).

## Track 2: Improve Usability of the Application

The application we built in class today is far from perfect.  Your task is to identify 3 improvements that you will make to the application.

The improvements must be related to authentication in some way, but could also include:
* Data Validations
* Logging
* Refactoring

✅Send a list of improvements you would like to make to your instructors - they will approve, or ask for updates!

After you list of improvements is approved, checkout a new branch and implement your list!

✅Commit and push your improvements branch.  Create a Pull Request and send a link to that PR to your instructors.
