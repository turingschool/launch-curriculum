## Disordered Orders

Today, you are joining the Disordered Orders development team.  You have been tasked with refactoring their order-creating application.

### Setup

* Fork and Clone this [starter repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/DisorderedOrders)
* Run `update-database` in the DisorderedOrdersMVC project
* Run all test in the DisorderedOrdersTests project
* If you run into any errors, reach out to your instructor!

### The Refactors
Implement the following refactoring patterns.  In your submission, we will ask for some reflection on each, so it would be helpful to keep notes as you go!

[ ] Extract Interfaces

[ ] Extract Methods

[ ] 🌶️ Move Methods

[ ] 🌶️🌶️ Extract Classes (We didn't cover this one in class!)

[ ] 🌶️🌶️🌶️ Any other refactoring pattern that you think would make this code better

As you refactor, keep in mind that refactors **should not** cause any existing tests to break.  You may need to add tests, but you should not remove or change any existing tests.

### Submission

Create a slack message to all of your instructors.  For each refactor that you completed, reflect on the following:
1. What problem were you trying to solve?
2. What refactoring pattern did you use, and why did you choose that pattern?
3. How did the refactor go? What was easy/difficult about it, and would you do anything different if you had more time?
