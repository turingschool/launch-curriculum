title: Error Handling Lab
---

In today's lab, we are going to continue adding Error Handling to our MVC Movies Application.

### Step 1: Adding Null Checking

First check out a new branch. Then add null checking throughout the rest of the application.

Once you think your application is thoroughly null-checked, create a PR and have a code review session with a peer.

### Step 2: Adding Validation

First check out a new branch. Then add validations throughout the rest of the application.

Once you think your application is thoroughly validated, create a PR and have a code review session with a peer.

### Step 3: Sad Path Testing

First check out a new branch. Then spend five minutes researching "Sad path testing". Send a description of sad path testing in your own words to all instructors.

Then add two "Sad path" tests to your application.

Once you have added your tests, create a PR and have a code review session with a peer.

    If students finish early and are looking for more to do, you could point them towards researching/implementing a global exception handler or a custom error page.</p>
